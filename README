landiallerd.py is the LANdialler server program. Along with
landialler.py (the client, packaged separately), it enables a group of
workstations (Windows, Linux, and probably MacOS) to control a single
modem on a Unix server.

LANdialler is useful if the Unix server is configured to route packets
between the Internet and the workstations (e.g. via NAT or IP
Masquerading), providing all the workstations with Internet access
(and control of the modem).
